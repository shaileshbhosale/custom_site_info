## Total time to complete task
6 Hours

## Note
It is not very clear whether to change text of "Save configuration" button to
 "Update Configuration" after adding Site API Key or keep it changed forever.
 For now I have changed it to "Update Configuration" in any condition.
 But it can be changed depending on whether Site API Key is entered or not.

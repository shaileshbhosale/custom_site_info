# custom_site_info
This module needs to alter the existing Drupal "Site Information" form.

## Resources
- [Create a Drupal 8 module using Drupal Console](https://www.cloudways.com/blog/how-to-create-a-drupal-8-module-via-drupal-console/)
- [Custom JSON response](https://drupal-up.com/blog/custom-drupal-8-module-json-response)
- [How to remove system.site configurations on module uninstall](https://www.drupal.org/forum/support/module-development-and-code-questions/2015-09-09/how-to-remove-mymodule-configurations)

## Total time to complete task
6 Hours

## Note
It is not very clear whether to change text of "Save configuration" button to "Update Configuration" after adding Site API Key or keep it changed forever. For now I have changed it to "Update Configuration" in any condition. But it can be changed depending on whether Site API Key is entered or not.
